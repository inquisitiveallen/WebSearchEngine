A visual editor, or full-screen editor is computer software for editing text files using a textual or graphical user interface which displays the content (text) in an easy to look at and good view; that is, it displays a portion of the opened file and updates it in real time. By definition, all visual editors require a re-fresh-able display device and all editors with a GUI are visual. Editors that are running through a command-line interpreter, however, may or may not be.
