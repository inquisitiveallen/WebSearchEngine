! - Wikipedia ! From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Redirect page Jump to navigation Jump to search Redirect to: Exclamation mark This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect: From a Unicode character: This is a redirect from a single Unicode character to an article or Wikipedia project page that infers meaning for the symbol. Examples would be monetary symbols like dollar and euro signs, language symbols, emoji, and so on. For a multiple-character-long title with diacritics, use template {{R from diacritics}} instead. For codes such as "U+00E6", use {{R from Unicode code}}. From a symbol: This is a redirect from a symbol to the meaning of the symbol or to a related topic. From ASCII-only title: This is a redirect from a title in only basic ASCII characters to a title with differences that 1) are non-ASCII symbols, but 2) are not diacritical marks (accents, umlauts, and so forth – use {{R to diacritics}} instead), and also 3) are not ligatures (like æ and Œ – use {{R to ligature}} instead). From a page move: This is a redirect from a page that has been moved (renamed) or is the result of a page move. One reason this page was kept as a redirect is to avoid breaking links, both internal and external, that may have been made to the old page name. Any redirect with a page move logged on its history page should be tagged with this rcat template. From a printworthy page title: This is a redirect from a title that would be helpful in a printed or CD/DVD version of Wikipedia. See Wikipedia:Printability for more helpful information.When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
